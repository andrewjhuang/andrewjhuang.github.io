Hi, I'm Andrew! 

I'm a 17 year old student at Belmont High School interested in urban environments, design, and sociology. I am passionate about using design and technology to make a positive impact on my community. 

In my free time, I bake, explore the world, stare into the sky, and discover architecture.

### Bio

I previously did Research at Tufts, investigating novel ways of artificial photosynthesis.

Before that, I started Farmore, an agriculture tech startup, at MIT LaunchX.
